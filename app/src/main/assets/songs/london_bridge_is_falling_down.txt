Build it up with sticks and stones,
Sticks and stones, sticks and stones,
Build it up with sticks and stones,

Sticks and stones will all fall down,
All fall down, all fall down,
Sticks and stones will all fall down,
My fair lady.

Bend and break, bend and bow
iron and steel will bend and bow
My fair lady

Build it up with silver and gold
Silver and gold, silver and gold
Build it up with silver and gold
My fair lady

Silver and gold will be stolen away
Stolen away, stolen away
Silver and gold will be stolen away
My fair lady

Build it up with bricks of shaw
