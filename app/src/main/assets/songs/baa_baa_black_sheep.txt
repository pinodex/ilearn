Sharing makes our life happy baa baa
The more we share the more we have baa baa
Sharing makes our life joyful baa baa
Sharing is a way of caring baa baa

Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full!

One for the master,
One for the dame,
One for the little boy
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, white sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir,
Three bags full...

One for the master,
One for the dame,
One for the little girl
Who lives down the lane

Baa, baa, brown sheep,
Have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir,
Three bags full...

One for the master,
One for the dame,
And one for the old man
Who lives down the lane

Giving, caring, sharing, helping
Shows your way of loving
Loving, caring, sharing, helping
Are our ways of living 
 
Baa, baa, all sheep
have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir
Many bags full

Some for my master
Some for my future
The rest for sharing
With the people on the lanes
