Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

Row, row, row your boat
Gently up the creek, if you see a crocodile
Don't forget to shriek!

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the river If you see a polar bear
Don't forget to shiver!

Row, row, row your boat
Gently to the shore
If you see a lion there
Don’t forget to roar!
