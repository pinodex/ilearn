The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again

The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
And the itsy bitsy spider climbed up the spout again
